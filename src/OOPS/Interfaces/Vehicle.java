public interface Vehicle {
    /*
    Interface: Interface is an abstract type which is used to specify the behaviour of the class.
    For Example: Lets take a human being where some of the behaviours are eat,talk, play, sleep, think.
    So these behavoiurs can be specified in a interface which are common for all human being.

    A interface is a blue print of behaviour like class which is blueprint of object.

    In any interface all the variables are declared as public, static , final by default.
    All the methods in the interface dont have method body except method signature.

    Any class which implements this interface will implement all the methods defined in the interface.

    To use interface in any class we need to implement the interface using implements keyword.
     Ex: public class A implements i

     Usually a class can extends only one class but a class can implements multiple interfaces.

     Lets consider the real world example:
     For instance vehicles like car, bike, bicycle have some common functionalities. We can put these common functionalities
     in the interface and lets the functionalities can be implemented in the respective classes in their own ways.
