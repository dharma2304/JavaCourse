        2. Private: If we specify the private access modifier before any variable/method/class then they are accessible
                    within the class only.

        3. Public: If we specify the public access modifier before any variable/method/class then they are accessible
                    to everyone in all the packages of application.For instance if we declare a class a public then that class
                    will be available to all the classes in the application.

        4. Protected: If we specify the protected access modifier before any variable/method/class then they are accessible
