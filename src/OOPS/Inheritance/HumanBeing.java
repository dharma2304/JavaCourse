    /*
     Understanding Inheritance: Basically inheritance is hierarchy between the classes by inheriting the properties of the classes.

     Lets understand with an example:

     Lets consider 2 entities --> Male and Female

     Listing the down the properties of male
     * eyes
     * nose
     * teeth
     * ears
     * hands
     * legs
     * hair
     * chest
     * penis
     * anus

     Listing down the properties of female

     * eyes
     * nose
     * teeth
     * ears
     * hands
     * legs
     * hair
     * breasts
     * Vagina
     * anus

     If we observe both male and female are human being. We can assume human being is the parent class and male and female are the
     child classes. And male and female classes has a IS-A relationship with human being.

     male is a human being
     female is a human being

     Male and Female classes have some common properties which every humanbeing can have. So we can move the common
     properties to human being class and child classes inherit from the human being class

     So the properties which goes to human being class are

      * eyes
     * nose
     * teeth
     * ears
     * hands
     * legs
     * hair
     * anus

     And in Male class we define only 2 properties
     * chest
     * penis

     And in Female class we define only 2 properties
     * breasts
     * vagina
