    /*
      Collections: It is a framework of classes and interfaces which is used to store and process the collection of objects efficiently.
      The utility package, (java.util) contains all the classes and interfaces that are required by the collection framework.
      The collection framework contains an interface named an iterable interface which provides the iterator to iterate through all the collections.
      This iterable interface is extended by the main collection interface which acts as a root for the collection framework.
      All the collections extend this collection interface thereby extending the properties of the iterator and the methods of this interface.

                                    Collection (root interface)


                  Set(interface)            List(interface)         Queue(interface)         Dequeue(interface)

                           We have several respective classes which implements these interfaces.
