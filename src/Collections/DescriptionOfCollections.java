      This iterable interface is extended by the main collection interface which acts as a root for the collection framework.
      All the collections extend this collection interface thereby extending the properties of the iterator and the methods of this interface.

                  Set(interface)            List(interface)         Queue(interface)         Dequeue(interface)
                           We have several respective classes which implements these interfaces.

            We have a separate hierarchy for map interface.
